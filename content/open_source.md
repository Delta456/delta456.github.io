Contributing to Open Source üåè since mid 2019.

### [The V Programming Language](https://vlang.io/)

My first open-source organization on which I started to contribute to and done a lot of significant things there. Check out my [commits](https://github.com/vlang/v/commits?author=Delta456) and [PRs](https://github.com/vlang/v/pulls/Delta456) done by me there!

### Highlights

- Fixed several _checker_, _parser_, _scanner_, and _code generation-related_ issues.
- Implemented features like `operator overloading`, `syntax highlighting for v doc`, `match branch range expressions with constants`, `non-string map keys`, etc.
- Documented and developed several standard library features.

#### Limited Operator Overloading

```v
struct Vec {
    x int
    y int
}

fn (a Vec) str() string {
    return '{${a.x}, ${a.y}}'
}

fn (a Vec) + (b Vec) Vec {
    return Vec{a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y}
}

fn (a Vec) - (b Vec) Vec {
    return Vec{a.x - b.x, a.y - b.y}
}

fn main() {
    a := Vec{2, 3}
    b := Vec{4, 5}
    mut c := Vec{1, 2}

    println(a + b) // "{6, 8}"
    println(a - b) // "{-2, -2}"
    c += a
    //^^ autogenerated from + overload
    println(c) // "{3, 5}"
}
```

Implemented in PRs [#7737](https://github.com/vlang/v/pull/7737), [#774](https://github.com/vlang/v/pull/7774), [8030](https://github.com/vlang/v/pull/8030), [8067](https://github.com/vlang/v/pull/8067), [#8086](https://github.com/vlang/v/pull/8086), [#9529](https://github.com/vlang/v/pull/9529) and [#9529](https://github.com/vlang/v/pull/9529) and more

#### Match with Const Expr

```v
const start = 1

const end = 10

c := 2
num := match c {
    start...end {
        1000
    }
    else {
        0
    }
}
println(num)
// 1000
```

Implemented in PRs [#16526](https://github.com/vlang/v/pull/16526) and [#19572](https://github.com/vlang/v/pull/19572)

### [Charm](https://charm.sh/)

Charm is an organization where the command line is made glamorous üå†

I am an active contributor and implemented features there.

#### [vhs](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs)

Write terminal GIFs as code for integration testing and demoing your CLI tools.

Implemented [Copy + Paste command](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs/pull/376) which copies the given text and paste it in the terminal.

### [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)

[Nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) is a collection of over
80,000 software packages that can be installed with the
[Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) package manager. It also implements
[NixOS](https://nixos.org/nixos/), a purely-functional Linux distribution.

Learning nix and working as a maintainer for The V Programming Language package since November 2023.

### [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/)

A community-driven color scheme meant for coding, designing, and much more! üñåÔ∏è

A maintainer for [The V Programming Language port](https://github.com/catppuccin/v) since October 2023.

### [V By Examples](https://github.com/v-community/v_by_example)

V by Example is a direct introduction to V by using annotated program examples.

- Translated in eight languages.
- One of the maintainers of the project
- Covers a lot of topics of V.

### [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli)
